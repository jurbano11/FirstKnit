# A Little Survey

Here are just a few questions so I can get to know you and so you can get practice submitting an assignment in Canvas.  For each question, insert your answer underneath. Make sure each answer is at the minimum a complete sentence with correctly spelled words and correct puncuation. 

## A short history of you.  
Where did you attend High School, and did you graduate? Compare english class to math, is one easier for you than the other? Finally which subject did you do the best in? Your answer should have at least two sentences devoted to each question.  
  
### my answer     
I attended Quartz Hill High School and graduated in 2020. Since it was during the outbreak of the pandemic, the graduation was held by having cars drop off their kids at a podium to receive their diplomas, take quick photos, and then proceed to leave. Math is a preferred subject, though I can debate that it is not an easier subject because one misstep in a problem can be the equivalent to finding a missing apostrophe in code, English is an easier subject since it is a subject of interpretation and finding meanings to works. Overall I did much better in math because of that reason, especially having had a teacher that was willing to point out where the misstep in the problem occurred so the student didn't have to spend more time finding that missing apostrophe from code. The subject in high school I felt o do personally best in is chemistry. Though cemistry can appear complicated, dissecting each problem makes one realize that the periodic table in most cases is only a reference point for problems in chemistry along with knowing how to convert units, the rest of chemistry problem-solving is simple math.

     


## Your computer and your and its capability?  
 For this class  you need a computer you can use at home.  So, what kind is it (windows, Apple, Linux)?  On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is a total dummy (doesn't know a mouse from a keyboard) and 10 is a complete geek (knows computer stuff in and out) How do you rate yourself?  You also need to have have internet access. How is your connection to the internet where you live?

### my answer   
Currently, I run a MacBook at home, though I have completely forgot what version MacBook it is, it s a newer one. On the scale of computer knowledge, I would rate myself a 7 because though I can easily navigate my way around the web and even know a little bit of code, I do not know specific and intricate parts of a computer as one might know of if they built a pc. The Interet connection where I'm from is fairly stable and mostly consistent from the area I work on assignments merely because of the router location compared to my personal work area. 


## Others and You?   
What name do you prefer to be called by your classmates and instructor, if your buddys call you something but you want people in the class to call you something else - what would that be? 

### my answer     
By classmates and instructors, I'd prefer to be called "Jonathan" as it is my birth name. Though buddies of mine have nicknames for me, it always begins as "Jonathan"
 




## Aspirations?   
What do you want to achieve in life?  What college subject do you think would be of the greatest interest to you? What degree or certificate are you trying to achieve?

### my answer     

 




## Past adventures?  
Have you ever gone to foreign countries, if so which ones, if not Where might you go in the future?  Have you ever been in the military, if so which branch, if not which branch would you choose if you got drafted, and why?

### my answer     

  




## Why are you taking Statistics?  
Did you take Math 115 or Math 116 ?  Did you know Math 115 only satisfies a general education requirement but that Math 116 counts as taking statistics in several transfer institutions??
